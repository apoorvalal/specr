# Contributing to specr

This outlines how to propose a change to **specr**. 

## Filing an issue

The easiest way to propose a change or new feature is to file an issue. If you've found a
bug, you may also create an associated issue. If possible, try to illustrate your proposal or the bug with a minimal [reproducible example](https://www.tidyverse.org/help/#reprex).

## Pull requests

*  Please create a Git branch for each pull request (PR).
*  Your contributed code should roughly follow the [R style guide](http://style.tidyverse.org).
*  specr uses [roxygen2](https://cran.r-project.org/package=roxygen2), with
[Markdown syntax](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/roxygen2/vignettes/markdown.html),
for documentation.
*  specr uses [testthat](https://cran.r-project.org/package=testthat). Adding tests to the PR makes it easier for me to merge your PR into the code base.
